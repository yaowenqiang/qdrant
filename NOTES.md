Vector embeddings


Searching vectors

euclidean(欧几里得)

> Distance between two vectors, smaller the distance, similar the vecgors are

cosine

> Cosine of the angle between two vectors.Larger the value, similar the vectors are.


dot product

> the dot product, also called scalar product, is a measure of how closely two vectors align, in terms of the directions they point .Larger the value, similar the vectors are
